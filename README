blktool README

Every once in a while I need to parse a very large blkparsed data--some 
are over 70GB. This is a tool to parse such data, and I am planning to 
add some useful feasibilities. I thought of making the program in other 
language, but processing such large files are often very slow on script 
languages.

blkparse already provide rich formatting syntax. This is not an effort to 
rewrite it, but to provide fast or easier workaround for some of tedious 
tasks I often encounter.
